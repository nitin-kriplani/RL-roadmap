# RL Roadmap

A structured learning path for Reinforcement Learning following mainly David Silver's lecture series.

## Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive roadmap for learning Reinforcement Learning concepts through organized weekly modules.

## Curriculum

### Week 1: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
- Introduction to MDPs
- State, action, and reward spaces
- Transition dynamics
- Value functions and Bellman equations

### Week 2: Dynamic Programming
- Policy evaluation
- Policy iteration
- Value iteration
- Applications of DP in RL

### Week 3: Model-Free Prediction and Control
- Monte Carlo methods
- Temporal Difference (TD) learning
- SARSA (on policy)
- Q learning
- Cart Pole Problem Implementation using Q learning
